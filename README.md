#FDF (Fil de Fer)

FDF is a 3D wireframe graphics project that utilizes the Minilibx library. It focuses on rendering wireframe models from maps, offering users a platform to manipulate and visualize geometric shapes and structures in three dimensions. 
By leveraging the Minilibx library, FDF streamlines the process of generating and displaying wireframe graphics, making it an essential tool for exploring and understanding 3D visualization techniques.
